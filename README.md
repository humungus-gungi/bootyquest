In the Guardian Temple
--------------------------------

- Imwe recruits *Ifa Kell* (Guardians of the Whills)
	+ Recommends use of pilgrims (other party members)
	+ Holochron contains all their records --> journal of the Whills, archives of the galaxy. Otherwise everything will be forgotten. All records are here - Empire wishes to destroy.

- Checkpoint with 4 troopers, 2 sergeants (result of 1 dark destiny)
	+ Jarlo and Ohesha decided to sneak through as merchants (force die roll to influence the checkpoint guards = 2 light side) to convince that he and Ohesha are going to a hotel on the other side of town.
		* Sergeant checks with radio
	+ Ifa Kell can find a back alley (flip 1 light side) with Gungi and Kasgan
		* They find themselves in the parking lot

_End of session._

Session 1 Experience Points
---------

- 20 XP for everyone
- Ifa +5 for achieving 2 Triumphs
- Jarlo +5 for excellent roleplay

Session 2 - Kessel and Digging Up Dirt on Oswald Flanigan
======================

Destiny points: _6 light; 1 dark_

On the ship
-----------

Tazzi is flying the ship through the maelstrom (some sort of nebula?) Tazzi says there are black holes  all over the place through the maelstrom.

On to Kessel to find our target, **Oswald Flanigan**:

- Polluted, lots of mining, lots of empire folks
- Oswald likely involved in spice transport
- Spice mining
	- Gungi's pretty sure spice comes from sarlacs on the surface

Kessel Trading Post
----------

- Landed, parking fee was 200 credits (from a Gonk droid)
	- Jarlo bartered the Gonk down to 100, Ohesha did a mech check to assess the decrepitness of the parking robot
	- Ohesha presses a button, turns off the bot
	- Team decided to remove restraining bolt and stash in the ship
		+ Ohesha didn't succeed with bolt removal, so tracker disabled but the bolt is still on

- In the trading post:
	+ Jarlo asks bartender about Flanigan:
		* "No, hasn't been around for a while, can't say I know what happened"

- Twi'lek woman (Lyn Rowan) comes up selling spice oil
	+ Jarlo approached with a very exciting business opportunity to be his own 'girl boss'
	+ After some charm and discussion with Lyn, Jarlo learns:
		- Flanigan's bounty has already been claimed,
		- She asks for 45 credits for information/a sample of spice oil/to join her MLM community
		- Jarlo convinces her that he will pay her in the future for her spice business endeavors.
	+ Lyn takes us to the bounty board, only one bounty there (for clearing rats)
	+ Lyn now definitely believes we will join her distribution community

- The Story of Oswald, *by Lyn Rowan*
	+ Boasting about magic shamans "getting high in the middle of nowhere", or something
	+ Tall tale until the bounty hunters showed up - doesn't know who the bounty folks are (official but not Empire, don't know who set up the bounty)
	+ Imperials would have brought troops, doubt it was Imperial
	+ Ohesha: underworld knowledge check to see who set the bounty
		* No success, one advantage - goes towards Lyn having more local knowledge
	+ Lyn took us to Niles (a Doc Badger looking guy) who really likes tracking tech
		* 	fee is 1000 credits to get positional data on our mark
		* 	Oops he's the guy who owns the droid we disabled
		* 	Jarlo coerced him to reduce the price to 700, continued to threaten down to no monies (but he doesn't want to see us around no mo)
		*  Flanigan was taken to a slave processing facility/mine 1/4 of the planet away - plan is to fly The Quest for Booty, then take the Winnebego
		*  Likely owned by the Pike Syndicate, slave processing facility
		* 	Paid 50 credits for a semi-dismantled slave shock collar for Gungi

Back on The Quest for Booty
------------------

- Tazzi has awoken the Gonk droid, it's repeating "credits"
- Ohesha broke open the parking droid - rolled 2 light side, 1000 credits inside
	+ Ohesha split to the party, 200 each
	+ Jarlo paid the 45 credits

- Ifa rolled 6 advantages, 1 failure on Knowledge check on Pike Syndicate:
	+ Spice is their deal
	+ Slaves also likely there (probs Wookies)
	+ Kessel Run something thing 12 parsecs
	+ Member of the Shadow Collective (coalition between different crime syndicates) - when you hear "Shadow Collective", expect dead

- Ohesha is surprisingly knowledgeable about spice:
	+ Spice has different properties based on where it's from, how it's processed
	+ Spice from Kessel will be made into glitterstim, really screws over the miners (makes them go blind)
	+ Most spices don't come in oil form, oil is used in processing (may be that this is a remnant of processing than anything else, it's a byproduct)
	+ Spice from Kessel is made by energy spiders and their webs, but they've been dead a while (spice is just in the environment)

- Group discusses several plans to get into the mining/processing centre, including:
	+ Pretend to be spice oil merchants, looking for some cheap spice byproduct for their chump market.
	+ Gungi + Gonk exchanged for something (basically a way to sneak them in) to allow for Oswald-searching-out and potentially slave-escaping-opportunities
	+ Also could pretend Gonk needs repairing.

_To be decided next time! End of session_

Session 2 Experience Points and Conflicts
---------

### XP
- +10 for everyone for getting the down low on Oswald Flanigan
- +5 for everyone for good discussion
- +5 for Ohasha for being really good at problem solving this session
- +5 for Jarlo for good role play and being very charming and intimidating. *What charisma!*

### Conflicts
- +3 conflict for everyone (stealing the parking meter droid and stealing its lunch money)
- +2 conflict for intimidating Niles (tech shop guy)
- +1 conflict for using the dark side in a Force Power check (Influence)

Session 3 - Operation: Kessel Emancipation
======================

Destiny points: _6 light, 3 dark_

On the ship and meeting the guards
-----------

Hatch a plan:

- Jarlo posing as a barterer with an old lady (helped by Wookie) - looking to make a deal for spice oil, a byproduct
	+ Gungi posing as assistant slave to Ifa
	+ Kazgan staying behind with the ship, pretending to be a pilot

- Pike syndicate guards waiting at the entrance
	+ Jarlo tries to convince them that we're just merchants, independents
	+ Guards call on the administrator

- Administrator Fen comes after a few moments
	+ It takes guts to come out unannounced
	+ Jarlo smooth talks him - trying to get them into the deal of selling oil to suckers
	+ Rolled charm with advantage

- After some discussion, including talk of disciplining Gungi the slave
	+ Jarlo, Kasgan, and Ohesha go with Administrator Fen
	+ Ifa and Gungi and Gonk to go through the mine and to discuss discipline.

Conference with Administrator Fen
-----------

- 60% of spice profits to go to the Pike Syndicate
- After some discussion, Fen leaves the room
- 1 light side point used to ensure that an interface is present
- Kazgan using Misdirect to hide Ohesha hacking in from a guard
	+ Rolled 1 dark side point, used anyway for +1 conflict
	+ Ohesha does get into a computer terminal, but **it is encrypted** (1 dark side point used)
	+ Ohesha failed, 2 failures

- Meanwhile, Jarlo made conversation with the guard - succeeded in making somewhat friends
	+ Asks if they can take a stroll around the compound - the guard responds that it's his job to stay here, he might lose his job
	+ Make your stay more...palatable?
	+ Kazgan name-drops "Oswald", guard recognizes the name
	+ Jarlo talked about their smuggling history, Kazgan fessed up saying "We wanted to shoot him"
	+ This sets up an absolutely amazing discussion about them shooting Oswald in the mines
	+ "Wouldn't it be fun to watch these guys shoot Oswald?" etc.


"They called it a mine...A MINE!"
-----------

- Take a trip down into the mines
	+ Going to a refining machine
	+ Big old Trandoshan (Chief Venek) being an asshat in from of the machine

- Pikes and Trandoshans are working on the machine
	+ Gungi wants to look at the machine for weaknesses, but failed real hard
	+ Will incur one black die if I try to do anything to disable the machine

- Takes Gungi and Ifa down into the mines
	+ 6 in this specific area
	+ Wookies are emaciated, all equipped with shock collars, chained up
	+ With Ifa and Gungi are Venek, two guards

- Gungi and Tukkuk meet - female wookie, high-level and healthy slave
	+ Speaks privately with Gungi:
	+ In the mine: 60 wookies altogether; ~1 guard for every 5 wookies

- Ifa communicates with Kasgan after going to the surface with Venek
	+ No sign of Oswald

- Fen came back - seems to be open to Oswald being killed by the team
	+ Real mad at Oswald for stealing spice and coming back talking about crazy spice force wizards

- Plotting on how to transport wookies:
	+ Are there other ships

- When the wookies hear the bang, it's time to start fighting
	+ They seem pretty keen to get out of here - great
	+ They have a proddy electric stick for mining

- 3 administrator folks (Ohesha, Kazgan, Jarlo)
	+ Go to a nice open air messing area
	+ Soldiers bring up Oswald
	+ Looking rough, mechanical hand borked
	+ Jarlo asks him menacingly, "Do you know how to fight?"
	+ Meanwhile, Kazgan sneaks to the emergency button, as Ohesha sneaks into the admin building as the alarm blares and blast shields begin to fall
	+ Kazgan takes a pot shot at Administrator Fen - got a critical

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="imgs/oswald.png"/></div>

- Wookies and Ifa
	+ Ifa nearby, Gungi is going to the nearest group of guards and starts aggro-ing as a distraction


Time to fight - _sound the alarm!_
-----------

> Roll initiative!

- Ifa - Medium range to Chief+machine, fires light bow at the machinery - machinery blows, chief caught in the detonation (engulfed in colourful flame) due to blast, chief on the ground looking up at Ifa.

- Gungi - M range to Chief+machine, moves up to stab with lightsabre after "500 CREDITS"
	+ Strikes Chief, 4 success, 2 threats - instead of killing him, chops off his arms, legs, and tail while he yells "You're all animals!"

- Jarlo, Oswald, Kazgan, Ohesha
	+ Jarlo first: shouts "Oh no! The empire is attacking!", uses Force Persuasion to put bad thoughts ???
		* Sees Admiral Fen contact the Empire for help
	+ Kazgan runs into short range, shoots 4s3a - kills Administrator Fen
	+ Ohesha hacks into a computer to send a conflicting message to the Empire, to confuse and slow them

- NPC turn
	+ Oswald runs into the Winnebego with Jarlo's gun (maybe a bit nervous)
	+ Caves: 2 soldiers who witnessed the explosion and Gungi's mutilation of Venek, put down their weapons - 6 wookies come out after killing their own guards  (will act on Gungi's turn)
	+ *Meanwhile, on the Courtyard:*
	+ 13 soldiers in the courtyard, just saw their boss killed. For the record, they are "Mooks"
	+ Group of 4 near their boss (group of 5 maybe) are going after Kazgan, take cover and start shooting.

	+ Caves:
		* Gungi runs to the next group of guards/wookies with his Wookie squad of 6 - successfully intimidates guard who was using shock collars on the Wookie cohort. Guard wants to run  at next opportunity
		* Ifa runs is and smacks the remote out of his hand, and Gungi gets it. The guard becomes a hostage, the 6 wookie corps becomes 11 wookies

	+ Landing area:
		* Kazgan has 5 guys shooting at him, tries to demoralize them (only 1 advantage, uses it to yell at Jarlo to get his blaster and shoot - +1 blue die to his next shot)
		* (Flips a light side point): there are turret guns around the mine.
		* Ohesha shoots at a group of NPCs: 6 success, 1 threat - they dead.

- Oswald takes two shots, and drops two of them right away.
	+ NPCs shoot at Ohesha, destroy the computer she's working

- Caves:
	+ Ifa and Gungi use manacles to tie up the hostage
	+ Deeper into the mines following the sound of wookies and blaster fire - they find 2 guards and 4 wookies
	+ Gungi: attempts intimidate and does so, so bad (1 advantage, 1 failure) - advantage emboldens the wookies being guarded by the 2
	+ Ifa: intimidate (4 success, 4 advantages) - very quietly walks over, takes their weapons, takes away their zappers and heel-grinds them, switches the chains over to the guards

> I will let you hug a wookie as a free action

- Landing crowd:
	+ Ohesha goes first: pulls out her lightsaber to deceive the guards into surrender, big success! They both drop their guns after believing she's a Guardian of the Whills. Asks them how to open the doors - one offers to do it for you.
	+ Zakgan shoots at a group of 4 running into the mines, they'll redirect now to the upper folks
	+ Jarlo tries to convince the remaining folks into giving up, given the damage and deaths that have already occurred (2s, 2a): they all buy it!

- Everyone on the upper layer can successfully escape
- 55 wookies survived, we get them in after Tazi arrives.

- We planned our way around surprises, and the ship is crammed full of wookie refugees AND OSWALD!!

- Retcon that Gungi definitely remembered to get the family charm held by Administrator Fen - belongs to Tekkuk's family

_Next session: Ask Oswald about things!_

Session 3 Experience Points and Conflicts
---------

- Kazgan: +1 conflict for combat being your first option
- Kazgan: +1 conflict for using the dark side to power your misdirect
- Gungi: +3 conflicting for maiming Chief Vennik

Session 4: Trippy Space Wizards?
=================

_aka. The Soul of All Things_

__7 light, 2 dark_

- All of the ship is full of Wookies, so any skill checks on the ship with the Wookies +1 black die

- As Booty Quest is leaving, the Maw is there and it sucks
	+ The Maw is a very tight area with beacons that show the path - the Empire has heard about the slave riot, and a Star Destroyer is there
	+ Communicators on the ship start beeping from the destroyer, the Wookies are starting to freak out
	+ Gungi does a cool check with Jarlo's help, (1S, 2ADV) - they quiet down (S), relax slightly (A), and Jarlo's talk on the com will be easier

- The ship shouldn't raise any red flags on its own
	+ The Star Destroyer stops them, asks them to power down and await inspection
	+ Jarlo to chat with them about how this is a waste of time
	+ Flips a light side point that there was no life-form scanning in this universe
	+ These attempts fail - we all accept the Maw as our saviour

- On entering the Maw, Tukkuk and Ohesha get ready to fix up the ship
	+ Dark side point: bolt of energy hits the hull, damages it.
	+ Ohesha repairs this
	+ Tentacle monster appears - Jarlo connected mentally to the creature and left it with feelings of good will

- Voice speaks to all players, none of the non-players - it speaks to your mind, but not through the ears
	+ Leads to a space station with a docking port, neither thought-projection nor using the coms garners any response
	+ The ship is landed, and Ohesha can fix the ship's strain without rolls
	+ Raw materials and a lot of time needed to fix the wounds on the ship (may be able to salvage stuff from the station)

- There is no one on the landing dock, but the station seems empty. A single door leaves the landing bay into the rest of the station
	+ Kasgan leaves through an open door - the hallway is empty, but there are beautiful painted murals all along the halls
	+ All except Gungi (stays with the Wookies) go down the hall

- Hallway murals
	+ The murals show 3 people, and old man, a young woman (maybe with a monkey or an owl on her shoulder?), and a younger man
	+  Ifa doesn't know a lot about the painting - her experience in the temple on Jedha saw lots of pilgrims, one of whom had an illuminated hologram made with golden pixels showing these three figures
	+ This is what some call the **Celestials** or **Architects** - ancient gods of the force
	+ The two younger ones battle each other and are commonly featured

- As the hallways continue, they find a sitting area with a single woman inside
	+ She welcomes them all to Centrepoint Station
	+ Jarlo went right up to her and asked a lot of questions
	+ "I have most recently been called the mother", of whom? She touches the mural of the three.
	+ Almost as old as the universe
	+ Ifa: "Were your children the light and the darkness?" - their nature, but not their origin
	+ Gungi arrives after getting a text from Ohesa - "I crossed the line, I no longer served my purpose"
	+ "Was once the servant of my children and the father. Over time I became the mother. I kept the balance, but I was like you once. Young, idealistic, mortal, but I crossed a line."
	+ Not immortality - "I drank from the fount of power and the pool of knowledge, and now I must be punished".
	+

+2 conflict Ifa for reading the Maw creature using the dark side

Session 5: Oops Force Mother called
=================

- Force mother waits for the group to follow her to meet a student
- Jarlo: What did you do with the ships that brought students here?
- Force Mother doesn't remember
- Ohesha: How long have they been here? - Some a long time
- "After they learned what I had to teach, they all decided to stay."
- Lisal is the student we will meet - "be calm, what you see may be concerning for you, but trust me: this is okay"

- Lisal's room
	+ Automatic door opens up
	+ Clearly someone lived here, but didn't much with them
	+ At the end of the room is a meditation chair - a cloaked female skeleton is in the chair, there is some flesh but it seems extremely old, odd that there is flesh
	+ Mother is standing by the door and gestures inwards
	+ everyone enters, the Mother requests that someone let her borrow their power
	+ Jarlo and Kasgan take 3 points of strain after volunteering (-1 light side point)

- Wakes up, says to Mother "Abaloth, Mother, why have you brought me back?"
- "You have been under for a long time, my faithful servant. I wish you to share with these."
- "Is this...this body is so restrictive," scratches her hand
- Gungi: "Were you beyond?"
	+ "Beyond is accurate..."
- Ohesha: "Dead do you mean?"
- Lisal: "How long have I been?"
- Mother: "About fifty lifetimes"
- L: "Is that all?"
- Abyssal beings are we, far more than this crude matter. Spirits extend further than you can imagine, entangled with the Force. All will find themselves [this way] before too long. But without control, substance, what makes you you. We can reach the realm where lost souls mingle, we can live free of physical limitations. We are called Beyond Shadows."
- The Mother's names: "Abaloth, one of my many names."

Questions:

Is this what you want for the universe? Exerting our will on the Force? Greedily grasping the threads of mortality that the Force only lends us?

Jarlo: What have you been doing?
L: I have been exploring the depths of my mind, of the universe, I was seeing how far the Force can go.
Mother: I've mostly been here.
M: Students help me in exchange for knowledge.
L: While I have been exploring beyond shadows, I've been able to feed Abaloth some of my connection to the Force. It is only through the power the students give her that she is able to find more students.
L has trouble getting up. Gungi helps her stand up. G: What has this knowledge given you?
L: No power, gained much power in the mortal realm - understanding of the universe.
Ifa: Has any of this knowledge helped others?
L: Yes, but not the way you think it should.
L: Mother sought power, and those that wanted to stop her imprisoned her. She's not a perfect being, but she is better than what we have and what history shows: this galaxy has been in constant states of war, and that can end.
Ifa: What if we can end it in a way that doesn't involve subjegation and slavery to the mother.
L: Every generation has said they can accomplish this: why is yours different? I just don't believe that you five can change it.

Kasgan goes to open the door across the room:

- In the room: another skeleton, similar to Lisal (at a meditation chair), sparse and differently

The party splits.

**Team Mother (Ifa, Gungi)**

Gungi: asks Mother "What do intend to do with the other crew members" - warns Tazi that they're coming over and to message Gungi if anything awry occurs.

Gungi and Ifa look around the Room of Murals - in each of the four rooms, there is a meditating body.
One room is a massive skeleton with 4 arms, southern room: priest looking person with a very decadent room (prayer), these rooms are much older than Lisals. In the NE room, there are 6 meditators in a prayer circle.

15 learners in the entire area.

**Team Lisal (Jarlo, Kasgan, Ohesha)**

- Wizard Patton Oswald (actually known as Oswald Flannigan)
- Jarlo messages Oswald, suggesting that the spice oil drugs that he really likes with his space wizardry stuff is in this case. If he wants to, he should sell it to her.
- Ohesha gets into the computer logs and finds out that the station is one of many - it is Central Point Station, and the series of stations create black holes. These black holes may control Mother.
	+ Killigs were the creator species - they imprisoned her here. We could try to steal information from them about how the space station works.
	+ Ohesha and Jarlo make a plan to tell Lisal and the Mother that they will seek out the other space stations.

- Tazi reports that Oswald has upset the Mother and she has him pinned against a wall
	+ Gungi and Kasgan run over to check it out
	+ Oswald's up in the air, 15 feet up, looking real upset.
	+ Gungi runs up, intimidates real good
	+ The Mother begins combat

- **Roll initiative**
	+ Kasgan first:
		* 3s 2a to her face, it flies through her and bounces off of the ship
		* OOPS IT'S NOT HER REAL BODY HAHA
		* You don't need a network of stations to hold a humanoid body in place - her body is an other-dimensional being
	+ As Mother laughs, her mouth rips into her face and her teeth grow; laughs with her jaw open
	+ Mother's turn:
		* She steals power from Gungi, he fails a save and takes 6 strain
	+ Ohesha's turn:
		* Mechanics check (3 success!! 5 difficulty) allows her to understand the systems of the station and turn up the intensity of the station
		* The station whirrs into action, creaking and running the coil hot

Ship's in very rough shape.

Remember your strain and wounds from last time.

Don't forget to roll your cool strain adjustment thing

Session 6: Maw Maw Maw Maw
=================

- Mairin's bad at notes, so here's the short run down:
	+ Mother proved that she can control folks at a distance and took over the minds of first one, then two, then one additional for a total of 4 Wookies mind controlled (Gungi disabled two of them, with three of them active at a time maximum)
	+ The Wookies were fought off mainly by Ifa and Gungi, sometimes aided by Jarlo and T'kok
	+ Meanwhile, Kazgan the masterpilot was doing a great job, and didn't even fire his guns over his shoulders but **definitely wanted to a whole lot**
	+ Jarlo used his abs and influence to convince the Wookies that fighting other Wookies is okay under the right circumstances
	+ Ohesha was all "oooh mechanics and astrogation", lots of **screaming** between the two stations
	+ Oops also Tazzi's arms got ripped off by the controlled Wookie right at the beginning

- Imperials showed up oh no!
	+ Recognized the ship as fugitives
	+ Were all "Yo board us I guess" to Jarlo, "Let us arrest you!"
	+ The Booty Crew said "No way!" and scooted off out of there, blamo hyperdrive activated, getting out of Dodge

- Also Oswald was there. And the Gonk droid I guess. He didn't say anything except "Dread...500 credits..."

Session 6b: The Afterparty
=================

- a few days of hyperspace travel
	+ HEAL UP - cumulative damage from slave riot, the Mother ship, and the wacky space battle from session 6
	
- Oswald and the crew have a chat
	+ Oswald was captured by the Pikes because he "borrowed" some spice to give to the Spice Wizards
	+ Gave flowers - taken away ages ago 
	+ Tracker guy: can follow someone from Bluetooth, for example

> Spicy force wizards

- Ohesha scans Oswald for a search
	+ A small chip in the ear (short range, ~2 inches) indicating a serial number (presumably slave #)
	+ Measures the Wookies as well, they all have a serial number - nothing else

- Jarlo: tell us more about the shamans
	+ Got a message out of the blue - request for additional spice
	+ Live on a life-filled planet, very nice - had things ready for him before he got there
	+ Giant mushrooms
	+ Had flowers prepared - blue and black flower
	+ Oswald was going to trade the drugs - apparently had special properties - figured it'd sell for a lot
	+ Flowers might have special properties if he ate them, but he didn't get the chance
	+ Was kidnapped by the Pike syndicate
		* Was about to leave the trading post on Kessel to talk to some of the contacts to figure out what the deal was with these flowers, was arrested outside of the trading post
	+ Jarlo: are you well travelled? 
	+ Oswald: has been around - had own ship, was confiscated by the pikes. 
	
- Oswald has contacts on Naboo, Ohesha wants to drop him off
	+ Naboo is solidly under empire control 
	+ Ifa: Did the force wizards speak with you, or just take spice?
	+ Oswald: They referred to me as Sentient, not much conversation
	+  Ifa: what did the Wizards look like - one was really tall, twice his height. Had a weird horn thing. Was nice, had smaller guys, knee high near him. Said everything will come together in time. 
	
- On the trip over, Ifa studies the holocron - the history goes back ~4000 years before present
	+ Ifa has two things she's curious about: how she fits into the history - showed up as a child, wondering if she's going to figure into the history
	+ Ifa finds history of those that drop her off - while she's searching, mentions of those subjegated by the empire; one section about the collapse of the Wookie civilization - Gungi reads over, including long records of  many, many species subjegated 

- Gungi learns about Wookie culture from the ship guests, borrows a data pad to record the stories of the Wookies
	+ Jarlo and Gungi also suss out if any of them want to come along with the group

_Several days pass, the ship comes out of hyperspace at a beautiful green and brown planet_.

- The planet is not in the holocron

- The planet is surrounded by a cloud that seems to be coming from the planet, forms rings around it
	+ Jarlo opens the coms, nobody answers
	+ Is Force coming off of the planet? Ifa says *yes*. We all notice this place is strong with the force. 
	
- We land on the planet - it looks like James Cameron's Avatar; Stellaris background
	+ Ifa and Ohesha are like, "Woah, this planet is the best place I've ever been"

Session 7: Fungusworld
=================

We start with star destroyer. It's in the maelstrom. It's in rough shape. It's fighting with a space squid!! And oh no, there's an inquisitor on board with the admiral!!!

The inquisitor seems to hear something in the maelstrom. This something seems upset, and seems to want to meet the empire ship.

Meanwhile back on the bootyquest, we've landed on the planet with spice wizards. The group hangs out for a little while, and meet some sentient Fuungli! They're mushroom folk. They're cute! They want to bring us to other humanoids! 

While we travel with the Fuungli, we learn that the Fuungli are part of Hango. Hango is "All and One". Eventually, we're stopped by Lexlin one of the Spice Wizards. They ask for knowledge, so we tell them all about the benefits of free markets! Then we go to a dark mushroom cove for a feast.

We learn about things from Lexlin
 - The Hangoids are leaving their homes as a consequence of helping our group
 - Somehow, the Hangoids expect that our actions will help them too
 - The wookies onboard the ship are likely to help the Hangoids in what they're doing later

Looks like the wookies are staying here!

Ifa gathers through foresight that Hango is Hang-ry for knowledge!

Lexlin brings us through the jungle to Hango. Hango will be hanging out here while the Empire hunts huts, but the rest of the Hangoids need to leave, to avoid leading the Empire to the Journal. Hango big. Hango old! Hango guards the journal of the will!!!

We hike into the Hall of Echos. We get on an elevator. It takes us to a room with a large robot. When the robot awakes, it accepts the holocron. It also records our life stories. It's happy with all that knowledge! And we get to enter the journal. 

The journal is a very very large room. It has some stairs, and a lot of 6-pointed pillars. The pilars have notches them with suggested writing. When we touch the pillars, we get visions of the events logged in the journal. When we walk through the pillar'd hallways to the glowing rooms, we end up in the blue world.

The blue world room has weird alien creatures in it! But they ignore us. It has distinct columns, and interesting paintings - including the celestials. There's a new painting being made, recording things they see in the notches of the column. There's a prophetic column which stresses touchers, but give visions of good jedis or murdered children. We meet a human force-ghost who talks us through some of the paintings.

Oh no! One of the paintings shows us that the Mother is being surrounded by the Empire's armada. 

We learn from a helpful force ghost that there are three people who may know how to kill a celestial being - one's in the Empire, one is in the Rebelion, and one's on Tatooine. Gungi learns that the one in the rebellion is Ashoka, and that she's on a planet where spiders walk on coral mesas. 

Ifa has a vision about how to defeat the Mother. All she learns is that there's a long time of darkness with a massive toothy Motherly presence. 

The human force teaches us all some of the skills from the Whills. AND THEN IT TURNS OUT HE WAS QUI GON!!!
