Session 1 - Escaping the Temple and leaving Jedha
====================================

Destiny points: _6 dark_

In the Guardian Temple
--------------------------------

- Imwe recruits *Ifa Kell* (Guardians of the Whills)
	+ Recommends use of pilgrims (other party members)
	+ Holochron contains all their records --> journal of the wills, archives of the galaxy. Otherwise everything will be forgotten. All records are here - Empire wishes to destroy.

- Checkpoint with 4 troopers, 2 sergeants (result of 1 dark destiny)
	+ Jarlo and Ohesha decided to sneak through as merchants (force die roll to influence the checkpoint guards = 2 light side) to convince that he and Ohesha are going to a hotel on the other side of town.
		* Sergeant checks with radio
	+ Ifa Kell can find a back alley (flip 1 light side) with Gungi and Kasgan
		* They find themselves in the parking lot

- Kasgan fired into a tent, startling troopers + sergeant to give J + O a chance to stop being bad at lying.
	+ Combat ensues.
	+ Escape with the Winnebego! (Jarlo's a civilian air speeder)

The Shipyard
------------------

- Need to meet T4Z1 droid at the shipyard across the city
	+ Meet the droid and make friends with him - he is now our protocol droid in the pursuit of **FREEDOM**
	+ Did it. Ran into Inquisitor - successfully Force-held the ship, but Ifa, Kasgan, and Ohasha's mechanic-ing, they got away.

On the ship
----------------

- Open the holocron:
	+ Inwe speaks first
		* 3 leads on where to find the Ancient order:
			- traveller told them a riddle maybe pro
				+ *the sun rises over the witches' tomb, and the last star from the citadel is your guiding light*
			- ancient creature on a planet (coordinates provided, not an Imperial hot spot)
				+ Apparently creature around longer than the Jedi, maybe know the way to the Ancient order of the wills
			- Pilgrim passing through said that a freight captain (coordinates provided) boasted he was sending shipments to Force Shamans somewhere in the unknown regions beyond the Outer Rim

_End of session._

S1 Experience Points
---------

- 20 XP for everyone
- Ifa +5 for achieving 2 Triumphs
- Jarlo +5 for excellent roleplay

Session 2 - Kessel and Digging Up Dirt on Oswald Flanigan
======================

Destiny points: _6 light; 1 dark_

On the ship
-----------

Tazzi is flying the ship through the maelstrom (some sort of nebula?) Tazzi says there are black holes  all over the place through the maelstrom.

On to Kessel to find our target, **Oswald Flanigan**:

- Polluted, lots of mining, lots of empire folks
- Oswald likely involved in spice transport
- Spice mining
	- Gungi's pretty sure spice comes from sarlacs on the surface

Kessel Trading Post
----------

- Landed, parking fee was 200 credits (from a Gonk droid)
	- Jarlo bartered the Gonk down to 100, Ohesha did a mech check to assess the decrepitness of the parking robot
	- Ohesha presses a button, turns off the bot
	- Team decided to remove restraining bolt and stash in the ship
		+ Ohesha didn't succeed with bolt removal, so tracker disabled but the bolt is still on

- In the trading post:
	+ Jarlo asks bartender about Flanigan:
		* "No, hasn't been around for a while, can't say I know what happened"

- Twi'lek woman (Lyn Rowan) comes up selling spice oil
	+ Jarlo approached with a very exciting business opportunity to be his own 'girl boss'
	+ After some charm and discussion with Lyn, Jarlo learns:
		- Flanigan's bounty has already been claimed,
		- She asks for 45 credits for information/a sample of spice oil/to join her MLM community
		- Jarlo convinces her that he will pay her in the future for her spice business endeavors.
	+ Lyn takes us to the bounty board, only one bounty there (for clearing rats)
	+ Lyn now definitely believes we will join her distribution community

- The Story of Oswald, *by Lyn Rowan*
	+ Boasting about magic shamans "getting high in the middle of nowhere", or something
	+ Tall tale until the bounty hunters showed up - doesn't know who the bounty folks are (official but not Empire, don't know who set up the bounty)
	+ Imperials would have brought troops, doubt it was Imperial
	+ Ohesha: underworld knowledge check to see who set the bounty
		* No success, one advantage - goes towards Lyn having more local knowledge
	+ Lyn took us to Niles (a Doc Badger looking guy) who really likes tracking tech
		* 	fee is 1000 credits to get positional data on our mark
		* 	Oops he's the guy who owns the droid we disabled
		* 	Jarlo coerced him to reduce the price to 700, continued to threaten down to no monies (but he doesn't want to see us around no mo)
		*  Flanigan was taken to a slave processing facility/mine 1/4 of the planet away - plan is to fly The Quest for Booty, then take the Winnebego
		*  Likely owned by the Pike Syndicate, slave processing facility
		* 	Paid 50 credits for a semi-dismantled slave shock collar for Gungi

Back on The Quest for Booty
------------------

- Tazzi has awoken the Gonk droid, it's repeating "credits"
- Ohesha broke open the parking droid - rolled 2 light side, 1000 credits inside
	+ Ohesha split to the party, 200 each
	+ Jarlo paid the 45 credits

- Ifa rolled 6 advantages, 1 failure on Knowledge check on Pike Syndicate:
	+ Spice is their deal
	+ Slaves also likely there (probs Wookies)
	+ Kessel Run something thing 12 parsecs
	+ Member of the Shadow Collective (coalition between different crime syndicates) - when you hear "Shadow Collective", expect dead

- Ohesha is surprisingly knowledgeable about spice:
	+ Spice has different properties based on where it's from, how it's processed
	+ Spice from Kessel will be made into glitterstim, really screws over the miners (makes them go blind)
	+ Most spices don't come in oil form, oil is used in processing (may be that this is a remnant of processing than anything else, it's a byproduct)
	+ Spice from Kessel is made by energy spiders and their webs, but they've been dead a while (spice is just in the environment)

- Group discusses several plans to get into the mining/processing centre, including:
	+ Pretend to be spice oil merchants, looking for some cheap spice byproduct for their chump market.
	+ Gungi + Gonk exchanged for something (basically a way to sneak them in) to allow for Oswald-searching-out and potentially slave-escaping-opportunities
	+ Also could pretend Gonk
