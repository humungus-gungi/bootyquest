Session 1 - Escaping the Temple and leaving Jedha
====================================

Destiny points: _6 dark_

In the Guardian Temple
--------------------------------

- Imwe recruits *Ifa Kell* (Guardians of the Whills)
	+ Recommends use of pilgrims (other party members)
	+ Holochron contains all their records --> journal of the wills, archives of the galaxy. Otherwise everything will be forgotten. All records are here - Empire wishes to destroy.

- Checkpoint with 4 troopers, 2 sergeants (result of 1 dark destiny)
	+ Jarlo and Ohesha decided to sneak through as merchants (force die roll to influence the checkpoint guards = 2 light side) to convince that he and Ohesha are going to a hotel on the other side of town.
		* Sergeant checks with radio
	+ Ifa Kell can find a back alley (flip 1 light side) with Gungi and Kasgan
		* They find themselves in the parking lot

- Kasgan fired into a tent, startling troopers + sergeant to give J + O a chance to stop being bad at lying.
	+ Combat ensues.
	+ Escape with the Winnebego! (Jarlo's a civilian air speeder)

The Shipyard
------------------

- Need to meet T4Z1 droid at the shipyard across the city
	+ Meet the droid and make friends with him - he is now our protocol droid in the pursuit of **FREEDOM**
	+ Did it. Ran into Inquisitor - successfully Force-held the ship, but Ifa, Kasgan, and Ohasha's mechanic-ing, they got away.

On the ship
----------------

- Open the holocron:
	+ Inwe speaks first
		* 3 leads on where to find the Ancient order:
			- traveller told them a riddle maybe pro
				+ *the sun rises over the witches' tomb, and the last star from the citadel is your guiding light*
			- ancient creature on a planet (coordinates provided, not an Imperial hot spot)
				+ Apparently creature around longer than the Jedi, maybe know the way to the Ancient order of the wills
			- Pilgrim passing through said that a freight captain (coordinates provided) boasted he was sending shipments to Force Shamans somewhere in the unknown regions beyond the Outer Rim

_End of session._

Session 1 Experience Points
---------

- 20 XP for everyone
- Ifa +5 for achieving 2 Triumphs
- Jarlo +5 for excellent roleplay

Session 2 - Kessel and Digging Up Dirt on Oswald Flanigan
======================

Destiny points: _6 light; 1 dark_

On the ship
-----------

Tazzi is flying the ship through the maelstrom (some sort of nebula?) Tazzi says there are black holes  all over the place through the maelstrom.

On to Kessel to find our target, **Oswald Flanigan**:

- Polluted, lots of mining, lots of empire folks
- Oswald likely involved in spice transport
- Spice mining
	- Gungi's pretty sure spice comes from sarlacs on the surface

Kessel Trading Post
----------

- Landed, parking fee was 200 credits (from a Gonk droid)
	- Jarlo bartered the Gonk down to 100, Ohesha did a mech check to assess the decrepitness of the parking robot
	- Ohesha presses a button, turns off the bot
	- Team decided to remove restraining bolt and stash in the ship
		+ Ohesha didn't succeed with bolt removal, so tracker disabled but the bolt is still on

- In the trading post:
	+ Jarlo asks bartender about Flanigan:
		* "No, hasn't been around for a while, can't say I know what happened"

- Twi'lek woman (Lyn Rowan) comes up selling spice oil
	+ Jarlo approached with a very exciting business opportunity to be his own 'girl boss'
	+ After some charm and discussion with Lyn, Jarlo learns:
		- Flanigan's bounty has already been claimed,
		- She asks for 45 credits for information/a sample of spice oil/to join her MLM community
		- Jarlo convinces her that he will pay her in the future for her spice business endeavors.
	+ Lyn takes us to the bounty board, only one bounty there (for clearing rats)
	+ Lyn now definitely believes we will join her distribution community

- The Story of Oswald, *by Lyn Rowan*
	+ Boasting about magic shamans "getting high in the middle of nowhere", or something
	+ Tall tale until the bounty hunters showed up - doesn't know who the bounty folks are (official but not Empire, don't know who set up the bounty)
	+ Imperials would have brought troops, doubt it was Imperial
	+ Ohesha: underworld knowledge check to see who set the bounty
		* No success, one advantage - goes towards Lyn having more local knowledge
	+ Lyn took us to Niles (a Doc Badger looking guy) who really likes tracking tech
		* 	fee is 1000 credits to get positional data on our mark
		* 	Oops he's the guy who owns the droid we disabled
		* 	Jarlo coerced him to reduce the price to 700, continued to threaten down to no monies (but he doesn't want to see us around no mo)
		*  Flanigan was taken to a slave processing facility/mine 1/4 of the planet away - plan is to fly The Quest for Booty, then take the Winnebego
		*  Likely owned by the Pike Syndicate, slave processing facility
		* 	Paid 50 credits for a semi-dismantled slave shock collar for Gungi

Back on The Quest for Booty
------------------

- Tazzi has awoken the Gonk droid, it's repeating "credits"
- Ohesha broke open the parking droid - rolled 2 light side, 1000 credits inside
	+ Ohesha split to the party, 200 each
	+ Jarlo paid the 45 credits

- Ifa rolled 6 advantages, 1 failure on Knowledge check on Pike Syndicate:
	+ Spice is their deal
	+ Slaves also likely there (probs Wookies)
	+ Kessel Run something thing 12 parsecs
	+ Member of the Shadow Collective (coalition between different crime syndicates) - when you hear "Shadow Collective", expect dead

- Ohesha is surprisingly knowledgeable about spice:
	+ Spice has different properties based on where it's from, how it's processed
	+ Spice from Kessel will be made into glitterstim, really screws over the miners (makes them go blind)
	+ Most spices don't come in oil form, oil is used in processing (may be that this is a remnant of processing than anything else, it's a byproduct)
	+ Spice from Kessel is made by energy spiders and their webs, but they've been dead a while (spice is just in the environment)

- Group discusses several plans to get into the mining/processing centre, including:
	+ Pretend to be spice oil merchants, looking for some cheap spice byproduct for their chump market.
	+ Gungi + Gonk exchanged for something (basically a way to sneak them in) to allow for Oswald-searching-out and potentially slave-escaping-opportunities
	+ Also could pretend Gonk needs repairing.

_To be decided next time! End of session_

Session 2 Experience Points and Conflicts
---------

### XP
- +10 for everyone for getting the down low on Oswald Flanigan
- +5 for everyone for good discussion
- +5 for Ohasha for being really good at problem solving this session
- +5 for Jarlo for good role play and being very charming and intimidating. *What charisma!*

### Conflicts
- +3 conflict for everyone (stealing the parking meter droid and stealing its lunch money)
- +2 conflict for intimidating Niles (tech shop guy)
- +1 conflict for using the dark side in a Force Power check (Influence)

Session 3 - Operation: Kessel Emancipation
======================

Destiny points: _6 light, 3 dark_

On the ship and meeting the guards
-----------

Hatch a plan:

- Jarlo posing as a barterer with an old lady (helped by Wookie) - looking to make a deal for spice oil, a byproduct
	+ Gungi posing as assistant slave to Ifa
	+ Kazgan staying behind with the ship, pretending to be a pilot
	
- Pike syndicate guards waiting at the entrance
	+ Jarlo tries to convince them that we're just merchants, independents
	+ Guards call on the administrator
	
- Administrator Fen comes after a few moments
	+ It takes guts to come out unannounced
	+ Jarlo smooth talks him - trying to get them into the deal of selling oil to suckers
	+ Rolled charm with advantage

- After some discussion, including talk of disciplining Gungi the slave
	+ Jarlo, Kasgan, and Ohesha go with Administrator Fen
	+ Ifa and Gungi and Gonk to go through the mine and to discuss discipline.
	
Conference with Administrator Fen
-----------

- 60% of spice profits to go to the Pike Syndicate
- After some discussion, Fen leaves the room
- 1 light side point used to ensure that an interface is present
- Kazgan using Misdirect to hide Ohesha hacking in from a guard
	+ Rolled 1 dark side point, used anyway for +1 conflict
	+ Ohesha does get into a computer terminal, but **it is encrypted** (1 dark side point used)
	+ Ohesha failed, 2 failures
	
- Meanwhile, Jarlo made conversation with the guard - succeeded in making somewhat friends
	+ Asks if they can take a stroll around the compound - the guard responds that it's his job to stay here, he might lose his job
	+ Make your stay more...palatable? 
	+ Kazgan name-drops "Oswald", guard recognizes the name
	+ Jarlo talked about their smuggling history, Kazgan fessed up saying "We wanted to shoot him"
	+ This sets up an absolutely amazing discussion about them shooting Oswald in the mines
	+ "Wouldn't it be fun to watch these guys shoot Oswald?" etc.


"They called it a mine...A MINE!"
-----------

- Take a trip down into the mines 
	+ Going to a refining machine 
	+ Big old Trandoshan (Chief Venek) being an asshat in from of the machine
	
- Pikes and Trandoshans are working on the machine
	+ Gungi wants to look at the machine for weaknesses, but failed real hard
	+ Will incur one black die if I try to do anything to disable the machine
	
- Takes Gungi and Ifa down into the mines
	+ 6 in this specific area
	+ Wookies are emaciated, all equipped with shock collars, chained up
	+ With Ifa and Gungi are Venek, two guards

- Gungi and Tukkuk meet - female wookie, high-level and healthy slave 
	+ Speaks privately with Gungi:
	+ In the mine: 60 wookies altogether; ~1 guard for every 5 wookies

- Ifa communicates with Kasgan after going to the surface with Venek
	+ No sign of Oswald

- Fen came back - seems to be open to Oswald being killed by the team
	+ Real mad at Oswald for stealing spice and coming back talking about crazy spice force wizards
	
- Plotting on how to transport wookies:
	+ Are there other ships 

- When the wookies hear the bang, it's time to start fighting
	+ They seem pretty keen to get out of here - great
	+ They have a proddy electric stick for mining

- 3 administrator folks (Ohesha, Kazgan, Jarlo)
	+ Go to a nice open air messing area
	+ Soldiers bring up Oswald
	+ Looking rough, mechanical hand borked
	+ Jarlo asks him menacingly, "Do you know how to fight?"
	+ Meanwhile, Kazgan sneaks to the emergency button, as Ohesha sneaks into the admin building as the alarm blares and blast shields begin to fall
	+ Kazgan takes a pot shot at Administrator Fen - got a critical
	
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="imgs/oswald.png"/></div>

- Wookies and Ifa
	+ Ifa nearby, Gungi is going to the nearest group of guards and starts aggro-ing as a distraction
	
	
Time to fight - _sound the alarm!_
-----------

> Roll initiative!

- Ifa - Medium range to Chief+machine, fires light bow at the machinery - machinery blows, chief caught in the detonation (engulfed in colourful flame) due to blast, chief on the ground looking up at Ifa. 

- Gungi - M range to Chief+machine, moves up to stab with lightsabre after "500 CREDITS"
	+ Strikes Chief, 4 success, 2 threats - instead of killing him, chops off his arms, legs, and tail while he yells "You're all animals!"

- Jarlo, Oswald, Kazgan, Ohesha
	+ Jarlo first: shouts "Oh no! The empire is attacking!", uses Force Persuasion to put bad thoughts ??? 
		* Sees Admiral Fen contact the Empire for help
	+ Kazgan runs into short range, shoots 4s3a - kills Administrator Fen
	+ Ohesha hacks into a computer to send a conflicting message to the Empire, to confuse and slow them
	
- NPC turn
	+ Oswald runs into the Winnebego with Jarlo's gun (maybe a bit nervous)
	+ Caves: 2 soldiers who witnessed the explosion and Gungi's mutilation of Venek, put down their weapons - 6 wookies come out after killing their own guards  (will act on Gungi's turn)
	+ *Meanwhile, on the Courtyard:* 
	+ 13 soldiers in the courtyard, just saw their boss killed. For the record, they are "Mooks"
	+ Group of 4 near their boss (group of 5 maybe) are going after Kazgan, take cover and start shooting. 

	+ Caves: 
		* Gungi runs to the next group of guards/wookies with his Wookie squad of 6 - successfully intimidates guard who was using shock collars on the Wookie cohort. Guard wants to run  at next opportunity
		* Ifa runs is and smacks the remote out of his hand, and Gungi gets it. The guard becomes a hostage, the 6 wookie corps becomes 11 wookies
	
	+ Landing area:
		* Kazgan has 5 guys shooting at him, tries to demoralize them (only 1 advantage, uses it to yell at Jarlo to get his blaster and shoot - +1 blue die to his next shot)
		* (Flips a light side point): there are turret guns around the mine.
		* Ohesha shoots at a group of NPCs: 6 success, 1 threat - they dead.
		
- Oswald takes two shots, and drops two of them right away. 
	+ NPCs shoot at Ohesha, destroy the computer she's working
	
- Caves:
	+ Ifa and Gungi use manacles to tie up the hostage
	+ Deeper into the mines following the sound of wookies and blaster fire - they find 2 guards and 4 wookies
	+ Gungi: attempts intimidate and does so, so bad (1 advantage, 1 failure) - advantage emboldens the wookies being guarded by the 2 
	+ Ifa: intimidate (4 success, 4 advantages) - very quietly walks over, takes their weapons, takes away their zappers and heel-grinds them, switches the chains over to the guards

> I will let you hug a wookie as a free action

- Landing crowd:
	+ Ohesha goes first: pulls out her lightsaber to deceive the guards into surrender, big success! They both drop their guns after believing she's a Guardian of the Whills. Asks them how to open the doors - one offers to do it for you. 
	+ Zakgan shoots at a group of 4 running into the mines, they'll redirect now to the upper folks
	+ Jarlo tries to convince the remaining folks into giving up, given the damage and deaths that have already occurred (2s, 2a): they all buy it!
	
- Everyone on the upper layer can successfully escape
- 55 wookies survived, we get them in after Tazi arrives. 

- We planned our way around surprises, and the ship is crammed full of wookie refugees AND OSWALD!! 

- Retcon that Gungi definitely remembered to get the family charm held by Administrator Fen - belongs to Tekkuk's family

_Next session: Ask Oswald about things!_
